Since I left my job at the end of October my anti-goal has been productivity and my goal has been to explore different ways of resting. I’ve been doing a lot of yoga, reading, cooking, and seeing friends. I also traveled around Europe for about a month to take myself completely out of my normal context; I find that immersing yourself in different cultures during solo-travel is both enjoyable in its own right and also helpful for reflecting on what’s important back home. I travelled through Oslo, Norway; Copenhagen, Denmark; Rome, Italy; Florence, Italy; Lausanne, Switzerland; Barcelona, Spain; Málaga, Spain; and Paris, France. My partner joined me in Rome and we traveled together for the rest of the trip.

During the trip we spent a few of our travel days on high-speed trains, marveling at how much nicer they were than flying and lamenting that we didn't have anything comparable back home. I talked with friends about sustainability and reflected on how much carbon my plane rides to and from Europe were dumping into the atmosphere. We also learned more about where food was being grown and how far it traveled throughout Europe -- including plans to take more trucks off the road and transport more food on trains on Switzerland! All of this had a big impact on my desire to look for jobs in the climate change when I got home.

After returning home, I started the process of researching jobs in the climate space and starting to send out applications. In addition to the reading, cooking, yoga, and seeing friends I've also started to add classes into my mix of ways of exploring rest. I'm currently working on building a Shaker style hallway table as part of a woodworking class.
