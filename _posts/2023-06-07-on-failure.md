I've started experimenting with two new hobbies: woodworking and pottery. The experience has been rewarding. While my professional work has had positive impact on the personal and work lives of the people around me, the changes that I've worked on have largely been process, culture, or technology based and have meant having conversations, writing, or moving ones and zeros around in the cloud. Creating and shaping things with physical materials in the real world is different and deeply satisfying. It's also been deeply humbling. Sometimes you can transfer what you've learned in other contexts to a new one, it works, and you can learn a new skill faster. And sometimes you start from square one. The skill is totally foreign and failure shows up quickly and often. Woodworking has been a lot like the former and pottery the latter, but both have provided a panoply of opportunities to experience failure. And I've been so grateful for this. Learning these new skills has given me the ability to reflect on how I solve new problems in new contexts and, maybe most importantly, the ability to explore my relationship with failure. This post will cover how I've approached certain problems, failed, and learned from those failures in woodworking. I'm still just starting my pottery journey and the learning experience is decidedly different; I'll explore that in a future post.                           

I started woodworking class back in January at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education. We all set out to construct some form of a [Shaker style table](https://www.woodsmithplans.com/plan/shaker-hall-table/), but there was room to scale our projects up and down depending on our experience, appetite for learning, and aesthetic desires. The instructor made it clear that his goal was to help students develop solid woodworking skills, which meant that we shouldn't bank on having a finished product at the end of the term. We could modify plans and potentially finish, but would miss out on some skills that were really fun to learn. This was a little disappointing at first, but was ultimately was freeing. I was only just starting my career sabbatical and this became an early opportunity to prioritize rest, curiosity, and exploration over productivity, perfection, and completion. I could focus on enjoying the journey instead of speeding toward the destination.

There are three waypoints I want to explore. Three failures. Three opportunities for reflection and learning. There were many more, but these stood out as having the biggest impact. The first came as I was planning and preparing to cut the stock I purchased at the lumberyard into the various pieces I would need to further refine before assembly. This provided me with a moment of reflection on how I have tended to approach uncertainty and complexity with comprehensive, detailed plans from the start -- and a clear reminder that detailed planning will drift over time and distance. The second came as I was cutting the first of six dovetail joints to reduce some bowing in the piece. Here I was reminded of the importance of setting yourself up for success before passing through one-way doors. The third came as I was cutting the second dovetail joint to reduce the bowing. This ended up being a rather difficult reminder about the importance of applying what you learn from your mistakes so that you don't repeat them.

**Planning with Complexity and Uncertainty**

<img src="/assets/img/woodworking-cutsheet-example.png" class="center" alt="A screenshot of the cutsheet I created to plan cutting pieces from my lumberyard stock.">

After going to the lumberyard and picking up all the stock, I needed to cut the pieces to specification so that I could work them and eventually assemble the table. There are a few competing goals in this stage, including wanting to cut efficiently to reduce waste as well as to plan how to showcase the natural beauty of the grain and its patterns when you assemble the various pieces together. I created a cutsheet using an online tool called [Opticutter](https://www.opticutter.com). I then came into the shop with my stock and cutsheet and proceeded to spend hours painstakingly penciling out all the cuts I expected to make on each board, trying to account for the width of saw blade and the grain pattern. What I'm fairly sure that the instructor had mentioned, but I failed to internalize, was that 1) it's important to have a little extra length on each piece as you start to work it in order to leave room for error (e.g., dropping the piece) and the vagaries of working with a natural material that changes based on its environment (e.g., humidity), 2) you _always need to measure from a square edge_, and 3) it's really hard to draw straight lines over long distances. I felt the cost of this mistake in terms of time and pride. But as Bob Ross might have said, it was a [happy accident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht9LMYivBnM).

This happy accident helped me see how I fell back into an old pattern of dealing with uncertainty and complexity, one which I fell into with IT projects. I would spend days trying to document and plan out projects with exacting task-level detail. I wanted to estimate time to completion with a high level of precision and remove as much uncertainty as possible. This approach wasn't totally useless. It helped me to think ahead and anticipate some critical pathways and problems that my teams and I might encounter. But more often than not, estimates were off or a change in timeline or customer requirements meant throwing out something and adding something new. As the level of detail increased and the time between planning activities and implementation activities increased, the probability of reworking plans increased dramatically. One of my mentors, [Alyssa Boehm](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssajboehm/), talked about this with her UX team in terms of level of fidelity when creating design artifacts. You'll save a lot of time, money, sweat, and tears by starting with low-fidelity, back-of-napkin sketches before jumping into meticulously drawn and annotated wireframes. Looking back now, it shouldn't be surprising to see this approach show up in a totally different context because it was a way of coping with a similar problem. It sure was a gift to be able to recognize it. Going forward, I want to try to plan enough to have a good idea of where I'm going and how to tell if I'm off track, but delay the detailed preparation until I'm closer to needing to do the thing.

**Setting Myself Up for Success**

One of the big differences between working with software and working with wood is that -- and I cannot emphasize this enough -- _there is no undo button_. On one hand, this is something that I would have probably told you before ever making a cut in this class. On the other hand, I hadn't yet made a meaningful mistake that made me really understand this both intellectually and emotionally. Luckily, I would make a few mistakes that would hammer this concept in. The first meaningful mistake arose from wanting to deal with a slight but material bow in the pieces of wood that made up the front apron (i.e., face) of my table. My instructor suggested that I could potentially straighten out the aprons by using a dovetail joint on a few of the cross-members (pieces of wood that help keep the piece structurally sound, act as drawer guides, and wood to which you can secure the table-top) to pull them together. Having never hand-cut a dovetail before, I practiced on a few pieces of scrap wood. This was great! I reduced the cost of failure and got to build up my skills. The trouble arose when I went to cut the first dovetail into the back apron. I cut it and fit the pin I cut on the appropriate cross-member into the dovetail successfully. When I went to dry-assemble the table so that I could measure the exact place to cut the pin on the other size of the cross-member, I realized that I had cut the dovetail on the bottom of the apron instead of the top. The bad news was that this wasn't exactly reversible, but the good news was that it was on the interior of the table, so you wouldn't ever see it.

Setting up systems to help yourself be successful and to reduce the impact of mistakes is something that I did all the time as an IT professional, so I'll admit that this mistake was especially embarrassing. Here, I was so focused on building the new skill that I forgot to step out of the immediate context I was working in and think about how the change I was going to make was going to affect the rest of the piece I was working on. Here I could have marked the wood with a pencil or tape to indicate where I expected all my cuts to be for dovetails before dry assembling the piece to confirm the locations against the drawings. I could have asked a classmate to check my work. In short, woodworking includes a lot of opportunities to make irreversible mistakes. But you can anticipate the types of mistakes you might make and then set up systems (e.g., pencil or tape markings, testing on scraps, dry assembling, asking a friend to check your work) to prevent yourself from making those mistakes -- or at least minimize the impact.

**Repeating Mistakes**

For most of my life I've heard something along the lines of , "It's fine to make a mistake as long as you learn from it and don't repeat it." That's why I had to put down my work, leave the shop, take a walk, and then leave class early when I made my second mistake. In short, I made my second dovetail cut on the bottom _exterior_ face of my front apron instead of on the _interior_ face. As you may remember from the last section, the first dovetail I made was in the wrong place but was on the interior, so was embarrassing but immaterial to the aesthetics of the overall piece. This was on the outside of the front apron, which was the most visible part of the table, excluding the top. So, to make a similar and _much worse_ mistake right after the first was pretty awful. Thankfully, I was able to flip the front apron such that the interior face became the exterior face. The grain wasn't as pretty on the inside, but it did allow me to save the work and continue without having to go back to the lumberyard.

This mistake led to a few insights. First, sometimes it takes some time and practice to internalize what I've learned, so I may make the same mistakes right away. Only a short period of time elapsed between mistake #2 and mistake #3, so I don't think I fully internalized what had happened and what I learned. Second, there's only so much I can learn on the fly without taking notes and intentionally reviewing what I've learned. Third, I was still upset with myself for mistake #2 when I make mistake #3. I wasn't in the right headspace to continue with work that involved irreversible decisions. This became abundantly clear to me after making mistake #3, so I packed up my stuff and went home early. So, what appeared at first to be making the same mistake twice turned into an opportunity to learn more about _how I learn_ and _what it takes to learn from mistakes successfully_.

**Building a Better Relationship with Failure**

I'm close to finishing the core of the table and then will move on to the drawers. I'm hoping that I'll be able to finish everything up over the summer during a third term of the class. As a person who has been a high achiever for most of my life and who lives in a society that ties the worth of people to their productivity, test scores, and comparison to others, I've been working to build a healthier relationship with failure. I wouldn't go so far as to say that I look forward to failure or that it's easy, but I have come to appreciate it as an important part of learning and not an indicator of my worth. It may be an indicator of my current ability, but isn't necessarily a predictor of my potential. I've also found deep gratitude for the frequency and magnitude of failure that comes along with learning a totally new skill as a way to deepen my empathy for others who are learning new things and failing along the way. I hope you'll also take the time to pick up a totally new skill, art, or craft. And I think you know what I mean when I say that I hope you'll fail.
