Since finishing up travels in January, I've started experimenting with two new hobbies: woodworking and pottery. The experience has been rewarding and deeply humbling. It's afforded me opportunities to reflect on how I approach solving problems with a lot of uncertainty. I've also been able to learn about how I learn in totally new contexts. What I've appreciated most, though, is exploring my relationship with failure.
