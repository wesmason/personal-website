I've started experimenting with two new hobbies: woodworking and pottery. The experience has been rewarding and deeply humbling. It's afforded me opportunities to reflect on how I approach solving problems with a lot of uncertainty. I've also been able to learn about how I learn in totally new contexts. What I've appreciated most, though, is exploring my relationship with failure. There's a lot to dig into with each and I've only just started the pottery class, so I'll focus on what I've learned so far in woodworking.

I started class back in January at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education. The instructor made it clear that his goal was to help students develop solid woodworking skills, which meant that we shouldn't bank on having a finished product at the end of the term. This was a little disappointing, but ultimately was freeing and let me enjoy the journey rather than worrying about finishing an entire table in 8 weeks. Two other key details are that each student was working on a slightly different version of a Shaker Table and the shop only has one table saw, one router, and one chop saw -- so we were all doing different things at different times.
