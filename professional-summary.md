I've taken the liberty of answering some questions you might have about my professional experience:

## Who am I, professionally speaking?
Iâ€™m a leader who thinks in systems thrives at the intersection of technology, people, process, and data. I strive to build delightful, valuable, technology-enabled experiences that help people and organizations focus on what's most important to them so that they can achieve their goals.

## What's my recent professional history?
Over the last ten years I've focused my professional energy into transforming internal IT at two companies into strategic assets. I was the first full-time hire for corporate IT at my last company, [edX Inc.](https://www.edx.org), and built a team of six people who focused on IT Operations and Business Systems. I lead IT as MIT finished incubating edX and we became responsible for our own payroll, retirement, benefits, and IT Services. I also led the internal IT team during edX's acquisition by 2U Inc. [in a deal valued at $800](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/2u-set-to-acquire-non-profit-edx-for-deal-north-of-600m) and stayed on for the following year to successfully integrate edX's IT capabilities into 2U's IT apparatus. 

## What am I up to now?
I started a sabbatical in November 2022 with the goal of resting, reflecting, and recharging. I'm now ready to explore new opportunities. [You can learn more about my sabbatical here](sabbatical).

## What am I looking for in my next role?
Climate change feels like the most pressing issue for humanity right now and I'd love to use my experience to help a small or mid-size organization scale its IT capabilities and increase its impact. That said, **I'm open positions at any mission-oriented company** for my next role as long as I can wake up every day and feel that I'm working with a team that's making the world a better place.

## What are some business capabilities and IT capabilities you've built out?

* Human Capital Management (HCM) / Human Resources Information Systems (HRIS)
* Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems (Salesforce)
