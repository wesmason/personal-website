## Who am I?
Iâ€™m a leader who thinks in systems thrives at the intersection of technology, people, process, and data. I build delightful technology-enabled experiences that help people and organizations focus on what's most important to them so that they can achieve their goals. Over the last ten years I've focused my energy on transforming IT from Help Desk to a strategic business capability at two small companies as they grew to midsize companies. I was the first full-time hire for corporate IT at my last company, [edX Inc.](https://www.edx.org), and lead IT through its divesture from MIT and subsequent acquisition by 2U Inc. [in a deal valued at $800](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/2u-set-to-acquire-non-profit-edx-for-deal-north-of-600m). 

## What am I looking for in my next role?
Climate change feels like the most pressing issue for humanity right now and I'd love to use my experience to help a small or mid-size organization scale its IT capabilities and increase its impact. That said, **I'm open positions at any mission-oriented company** for my next role as long as I can wake up every day and feel that I'm working with a team that's making the world a better place.

## What am I up to now?
I started a sabbatical in November 2022 with the goal of resting, reflecting, and recharging. I'm now ready to explore new opportunities. [You can learn more about my sabbatical here](sabbatical).
