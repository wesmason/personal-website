üë®üèº‚Äçüíª **I'm looking for my next role**. Know of a good company? [I'd love to chat!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weskmason)

I've taken the liberty of answering some questions you might have about my professional experience:

## Who am I as an IT Leader?
I‚Äôm a thoughtful, empathetic leader who thinks in systems and thrives at the intersection of technology, people, process, and data. I love to build teams that that can seek out opportunities to make the business more effective at achieving its goals and delighting its customers. I'm skilled at helping companies figure out when, how, and even whether to deploy technology so that they can meet their goals while nurturing their culture. Whether it's rolling out a CRM to enable Sales and Customer Success, integrating HCM and IT systems to enable HR-driven Identity and Access Management, developing a DEI governance framework, or partnering with Legal to develop information security policies, I love getting together with other experts to solve problems.

## Who am I as a manager?
I value curiosity, thoughtfulness, proactivity, good communication, and inclusivity. I reward demonstrated skill with greater autonomy -- and the expectation of spending more time to help others grow. It's important to me that the people on my team have the opportunities, support, time, and resources to grow. I believe that this development should never take a back seat, even if it means that members of my team hit the ceiling and need to move elsewhere to continue growing (though I'd much rather find a way to keep them and keep them growing!).

## What's my recent professional history?
Over the last ten years I've focused my professional energy into transforming internal IT at two companies. I was the first full-time hire for corporate IT at my last company, [edX Inc](https://www.edx.org). I built teams that were responsible for IT Operations (e.g., Support, EPM, SysAdmin) and Business Systems (e.g., Salesforce), which included two managers and five indirect reports. I led the IT team during the lead-up to edX's acquisition by 2U Inc. [in a deal valued at $800](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/2u-set-to-acquire-non-profit-edx-for-deal-north-of-600m) and stayed on for the following year to successfully integrate edX's IT capabilities into 2U's IT apparatus. During the year after the deal closed, I was also asked to assume responsibility for two additional teams. First, I started to manage the IT Infrastructure Team that was responsible for 2U's employee identity and access management services, physical security, and services like Google Workspace. Later I assumed management of a Productivity Systems team that was responsible for Atlassian Server and Cloud Products, Slack, and other productivity systems.

## What am I up to now?
I started a sabbatical in November 2022 with the goal of resting, reflecting, and recharging. I'm now ready to explore new opportunities. [You can learn more about my sabbatical here](/sabbatical).

## What am I looking for in my next role?
Climate change feels like the most pressing issue for humanity right now and I'd love to use my experience to help a small or mid-size organization scale its IT capabilities and increase its impact. That said, **I'm open positions at any mission-oriented company** for my next role as long as I can wake up every day and feel that I'm working with a team that's making the world a better place.

## What are some business capabilities and IT capabilities you've built out?
