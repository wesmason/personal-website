üë®üèº‚Äçüíª **I'm looking for my next role**. Know of a good company? [I'd love to chat!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weskmason)

I've taken the liberty of answering some questions you might have about my professional experience:

## Who am I, professionally speaking?
I‚Äôm a thoughtful, empathetic leader. I think in systems and I thrive when I get to work on problems at the intersection of technology, people, process, and data. I'm skilled at helping companies figure out when, how, and even whether to deploy technology so that they can meet their goals while nurturing their culture.

I love to build teams. I value curiosity, thoughtfulness, and teamwork and encourage good communication, inclusivity, and a focus on value. Demonstrated skill is rewarded with greater autonomy coupled with the expectation of mentoring others. It's important to me that people on my team have the time, opportunities, support, and resources they need to grow. I believe in investing in talent, even if it means that someone outgrows what a company can offer them.

## What's my recent professional history?
Over the last ten years I've focused my professional energy into transforming internal IT at two companies into strategic assets. I was the first full-time hire for corporate IT at my last company, [edX Inc.](https://www.edx.org), and built a team of six people who focused on IT Operations and Business Systems. I lead IT as MIT finished incubating edX and we became responsible for our own payroll, retirement, benefits, and IT Services. I also led the internal IT team during edX's acquisition by 2U Inc. [in a deal valued at $800](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/2u-set-to-acquire-non-profit-edx-for-deal-north-of-600m) and stayed on for the following year to successfully integrate edX's IT capabilities into 2U's IT apparatus. 

## What am I up to now?
I started a sabbatical in November 2022 with the goal of resting, reflecting, and recharging. I'm now ready to explore new opportunities. [You can learn more about my sabbatical here](sabbatical).

## What am I looking for in my next role?
Climate change feels like the most pressing issue for humanity right now and I'd love to use my experience to help a small or mid-size organization scale its IT capabilities and increase its impact. That said, **I'm open positions at any mission-oriented company** for my next role as long as I can wake up every day and feel that I'm working with a team that's making the world a better place.

## What are some business capabilities and IT capabilities you've built out?

* Human Capital Management (HCM) / Human Resources Information Systems (HRIS)
* Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems (Salesforce)
* Information Security Programs
* SaaS Administration and Integration
