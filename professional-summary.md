üë®üèº‚Äçüíª **I'm looking for my next role**. Know of a good company? [I'd love to chat!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weskmason)

I've taken the liberty of answering some questions you might have about my professional experience:

## Why would you want to hire me?
I'm skilled at helping companies figure out when, how, and -- most importantly -- whether to deploy technology so that they can meet their goals. I have proven experience in building IT teams from the ground up, starting as the first full time hire and then transforming them into strategic assets for the business. Whether agile transformation; divesture or acquisition; choosing, configuring, deploying, and maintaining a CRM, ERP, or HCM; integrating major, cross-departmental processes across people, processes, and systems (e.g., Lead to Cash, Employee Lifecycle); developing a DEI governance framework and setting goals; preparing IT systems and services for complex compliance regimes; or partnering with Legal, Compliance, and Security to develop IT and Information Security policies, I love getting the right people together to solve big, complex problems.

## Who are you as a leader generally?
The most important of part of my job is to create an environment where the people around me can be successful. At its core, that means a place where people feel included, appreciated, and safe. So I like to be intentional and explicit about team culture, including what good behavior look like how and how we address bad behavior without creating additional harm. I also spend time helping people understand how their work fits into the bigger picture, why it's important, and how it's helping us achieve our goals. No matter someone's role, it's important to develop strong business acumen. I want my teams to be able to think critically about the value of their work and to raise their hands when the value isn't clear. When there are obstacles, we work together to remove them. When there are failures, we learn from them. When there is good work, we celebrate it.

## Who are you as an IT leader specifically?
I believe that successful IT teams don't solve problems on their own. My teams learn to bring in the right experts so that they can build better solutions. They also talk with their customers early and often, from problem exploration through solution delivery and beyond. My teams also recognize that systems quickly become complex, making it difficult and eventually impossible to understand everything at once. They develop and iterate on good architecture, define clear ownership, establish quality monitoring, automate as much as they can, and work as teams -- not "heros", "rockstars", "ninjas", or "cowboys". I value good communication, healthy boundaries, and a sustainable approach to work. As an IT Leader, my job is to build an environment, culture, and structures where all of this can happen without me being in the room.

## Who are you as a manager of people?
I work to provide my teams with the opportunities, support, time, and resources to learn and grow. I learn about direct reports strengths and growth areas through conversations with them as well as soliciting feedback from their colleagues and customers so that I can help them on their career journeys. When there are clear development objectives, such as a promotion, we will co-develop an individual development plan for mutual accountability. As I support people in their development, I meet them where they are and work to develop competencies through coaching, supporting, and eventual delegation as they build confidence[^1]. Demonstrated competency is rewarded with greater autonomy and new challenges.

I value curiosity, critical thought, proactivity, good communication, and inclusivity. These are qualities that I work on developing in every team member because they're at the foundation of what sets my IT teams apart. The technical skills are easy to come by, but a delightful and truly excellent IT experience requires more than good tech skills. When someone brings a problem to me, I may have a perspective or a solution, but it's more important to me that we can get curious and think critically about the problem together so that they might be able to solve it themselves or with peers the next time. I ask all members of my team to work on internal customer-facing communications because it's a fantastic opportunity to communicate your requests or accomplishments in plain language -- and to be sure that what you've built makes sense and will result in a positive customer experience.

When it comes to inclusivity, one of the biggest challenges with corporate DEI efforts being successful is that they are largely opt-in. When it comes to building an inclusive culture, we have to be prepared to ask people in positions of privilege to examine and change their behavior. I expect members of my teams to understand and own the impact of their actions, no matter what their intentions were. When it can be done without creating additional harm, I also expect that people will try to amends for the harm they created. I'm there to show up with compassion and help them exercise these muscles, to provide resources for learning, and to facilitate conversations. Making mistakes doesn't mean you're a bad person, but it does mean that you need to try to fix them.

## What's your recent professional history?
Over the last ten years I've focused my professional energy into transforming internal IT at two companies. I was the first full-time hire for corporate IT at my last company, [edX Inc](https://www.edx.org). I built teams that were responsible for IT Operations (e.g., Support, EPM, SysAdmin) and Business Systems (e.g., Salesforce), which included two managers and five indirect reports. I led the IT team during the lead-up to edX's acquisition by 2U Inc. [in a deal valued at $800](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/2u-set-to-acquire-non-profit-edx-for-deal-north-of-600m) and stayed on for the following year to successfully integrate edX's IT capabilities into 2U's IT apparatus. During the year after the deal closed, I was also asked to assume responsibility for two additional teams. First, I started to manage the IT Infrastructure Team that was responsible for 2U's employee identity and access management services, physical security, and services like Google Workspace. Later I assumed management of a Productivity Systems team that was responsible for Atlassian Server and Cloud Products, Slack, and other productivity systems.

## What are you up to now?
I started a sabbatical in November 2022 with the goal of resting, reflecting, and recharging. I'm now ready to explore new opportunities. [You can learn more about my sabbatical here](/sabbatical).

## What kind of role are you looking for?
I would really like to continue my journey as an IT Leader in a Director or Senior Director level role. I love building teams and helping companies be more successful by transforming IT into a strategic asset.

## Are there any particular industries you're looking for?
I'm very open with respect to specific industry, as long as the company is mission-oriented, working toward a sustainable relationship with our planet, and making the world a better place to live.

That said, I'm most interested in finding a role at an organization that is actively working to prevent, mitigate, or reverse human-caused climate change.

## What are some business capabilities and IT capabilities you've built out?
I have experience building out, maintaining, upgrading, and transforming business and IT capabilities that include:
* Human Capital Management (HCM) / Human Resources Information Systems (HRIS)
* Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems (Salesforce)
* Information Security Programs
* SaaS Administration and Integration
* Business Process Automation
* Business Process Improvement
* Endpoint Management
* IT Support
* Network / VoIP
* Diversity, Equity, and Inclusivity
