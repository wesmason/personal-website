# Introduction 
I worked at edX[^1] for about 6 years before it was acquired by 2U in a deal worth $800mm[^2]. After the deal was complete, my primary focuses were continuity of operations as we started to plan for integration work and making sure that my team was seen, heard, and supported during the challenging cultural process of a company of 250 being subsumed by a company of 5000. I spent the next year integrating edX into 2U systems and services, taking on management of new teams, and trying to bring the best of edX culture and processes to a much larger company.

# Team
I continued to manage my existing IT Operations and Business Systems teams after the deal closed. I early January I was asked to take on management of an additional 2U team that had been without a manager for months. Over the following year, I was proud that the Sr. Manager of Business Systems was able to interview and move into a Director-level role within 2U and our Business Systems responsibilities were transitioned to other teams. Mid-year I took on another existing team and combined it with the members of the IT Operations Team to create a new SaaS Operations team, which would be responsible for centrally managed SaaS services across the company.

# Major Accomplishments
Here are some of my major accomplishments while at edX. Please reach out if you'd like to talk about any of them in more detail.                    

* **[2022-2022]** **Agile Transformation**: I spent several months observing and listening with my new teams and then attempted to enact some changes to help the teams become more agile. We moved to more inclusive, collaborative meetings by using Miro to allow all team members to contribute. We also moved away from Scrum toward Kanban, which allowed us to spend less time planning, increased our throughput, and still let us address the interruptions that are endemic in IT Operations. We also established work in progress limits to help engineers focus on decreasing time to value. I also encouraged my team to spend more time talking with our customers to understand their needs.
* **[2022-2022]** **Slack Roll-Out**: 2U used Slack for its technology team but then decided to roll it out to the entire company as part of the decision to close many of its offices. Due to some departures on my team, I ended up doing the majority of the work to prepare this service and roll it out to the company. This included building a Slack Bot that allowed users to self-service many requests that would have previously required a ticket by policy. In the first week since the service was launched, I saved over 2 weeks of administrator time through the bot in addition to providing on-demand service to end-users.
* **[2022-2022]** **IdPaaS Migration**: Both edX and 2U used the same IdPaaS provider and we worked to migrate all services from the edX provider to the 2U provider to improve employee experience, IT efficiency, and reduce costs.
* **[2021-2022]** **Google Workspace Integration**: Both edX and 2U used Google Workspace for email and other productivity needs. This project included migrating data from the edX instance to the 2U instance, reconciling configuration between the two instances, and guiding users through the change so that everyone could collaborate in the same place.
* **[2021-2022]** **Handoffs**: My teams and I worked to hand-off systems, services, and processes that other teams at 2U specialized in, including endpoint management, security, vendor review, and others.
