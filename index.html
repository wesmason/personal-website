<p>👋🏻 Oh, hello there. I'm Wes. I'm a queer, cisgender man and I use he/him/his pronouns. I'm so glad you're here.</p>
<p>💼 In my <b>professional</b> life I love to help small and midsize companies transform internal IT into a strategic capability. An agilist through and through, I build curious, thoughtful, and inclusive teams that work closely with their customers throughout the entire value delivery process. I measure success through time to delivery, the quality of user experience, the value for our customers, how we treat each other along the way, and our ability to achieve our business goals. You can learn more about my professional life on my <a href="professional-summary">professional summary</a> page.</p>

<p>💁🏼‍♂️ In my <b>personal</b> life, I drink a lot of coffee, take a lot of naps, practice yoga, cycle, dance, climb, sing, play board games, play video games, and plan elaborate theme parties with my friends. You can learn more about my personal life on my <a href="about-me">about me</a> page.</p>
