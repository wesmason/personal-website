Oh, hello there! 👋🏻

I'm Wes. I'm a queer 🏳️‍🌈, cisgender man 🧔🏼‍♂️  who uses he/him/his pronouns.

I grew up in Western Massachusetts in the United States 🇺🇸 and moved out to the Boston area in 2012. After spending a number of years in Cambridge, I've recently settled in Somerville and live with my partner 👨🏻‍🤝‍👨🏼 and more houseplants 🪴than I can count.

In my free time (which is ample these days due to being on [sabbatical](sabbatical)), I enjoy:

* 🧘🏼‍♂️ **exercising**, which includes yoga, cycling, occasional rock climbing, and weightlifting;

* 📚 **reading**, where my favorite genre is fantasy, but I also get into sci-fi and non-fiction;

* 👨🏼‍🍳 **cooking**, where I'm obsessed with [Melissa Clark](https://www.melissaclark.net) and many of the other contributors from the New York Times;

* 🎮 **gaming**, where I'm currently playing [God of War: Ragnarok](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/), but have also been obsessed with [Hades](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/); and

* 🎉 **planning elaborate theme parties with my friends**, which is a fun way of learning new skills (e.g., building a set wall with a mirror door, coding in Python with Philips Hue lights, constructing a giant chandelier) and channeling my creative energy.
