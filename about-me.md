Oh, hello there! 👋🏻

I'm Wes. I'm a queer 🏳️‍🌈, cisgender man 🧔🏼‍♂️  who uses he/him/his pronouns.

I grew up in Western Massachusetts in the United States 🇺🇸 and moved out to the Boston area in 2012. After spending a number of years in Cambridge, I've recently settled in Somerville and live with my partner 👨🏻‍🤝‍👨🏼 and more houseplants 🪴than I can count.

In my free time (which is ample these days due to being on [sabbatical](/sabbatical)), I enjoy:

* 🧘🏼‍♂️ **exercising**, which includes yoga, cycling, occasional rock climbing, a love/hate relationship with my upstairs neighbor's rowing machine, and weightlifting;

* 📚 **reading**, where my favorite genre is fantasy, but I also spend time in the realms of sci-fi, non-fiction, and glowing recommendations from friends;

* 👨🏼‍🍳 **cooking**, where I'm a huge fan of [Melissa Clark](https://www.melissaclark.net) and many of the other contributors from the New York Times;

* 🎮 **video gaming**, where I love getting lost in a good story (e.g., [God of War](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/)), exploring a massive world (e.g., [Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/)), and experimenting with strategies and tactics (e.g., [Hades](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/));

* 🎲 **board gaming**, where I love games like _[Betrayal at the House on the Hill](https://www.avalonhill.com/en-us/product/avalon-hill-betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-second-edition-cooperative-board-game-for-ages-12-and-up-for-3-6-players:8450F69A-05BE-4BB2-8146-EBCE86E4C868)_, _[Mysterium](https://www.libellud.com/en/our-games/mysterium/)_, and [Pandemic](https://www.zmangames.com/en/games/pandemic/) (I prefer cooperative to competitive games); and

* 🎉 **planning elaborate theme parties with my friends**, which is a fun way of learning new skills (e.g., building a set wall with a mirror door, coding in Python with Philips Hue lights, constructing a giant chandelier) and channeling my creative energy.
