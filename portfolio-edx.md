# Introduction 
edX was co-founded by MIT and Harvard in 2012 as a non-profit, open source platform for MOOCs (massive open online course). Partnering with colleges, universities, and businesses from around the world, we sought to provide access to high quality education to everyone, everywhere. In addition to courses and professional certificates, we launched additional programs including MicroMasters credentials in 2016[^1] and Master's Degrees in 2018[^2] with our University partners. 2U would acquire edX in 2021 in a deal worth $800mm[^3].

# Team
I joined edX in 2015 as the first full-time hire for IT. By the time the deal to acquire edX in 2021 was announced, I had proven the value of investing in IT and had grown my team to two managers, five individual contributors, and consulting resources across IT Operations and Business Systems.

# Major Accomplishments
Here are some of my major accomplishments while at edX. Please reach out if you'd like to talk about any of them in more detail.                    

* **[2021-2022]** **2U Integration Preparation**: After the announcement of the deal where 2U would acquire edX, my teams and I worked with our counterparts at 2U to prepare for a smooth cut-over and continuity of operations within the limitations of pre-close coordination. This included preparing for the integration of Google Workplace Instances, preparing HR data for import, and reviewing our eCommerce systems limitations -- in addition to standard due diligence requests.

* **[2021-2021]** **tCRIL IT Services**: The tCRIL (The Center for Reimagining Learning) was the non-profit entity that remained after the edX business was sold to 2U for $800mm. I worked directly with the future tCRIL leaders to learn about their needs and make recommendations for minimum viable technology capabilities. My teams built out the core corporate technology and CRM services so that tCRIl could continue to function without interruption. All of this work happened on an accelerated schedule while we were also preparing for the technology integration with 2U.

* **[2021-2021]** **DEI Governance**: I was a major contributor to our company's DEI program starting in 2015. Over the years, I worked with other employees to develop buy-in from Leadership and HR to invest in DEI. I led the development of our governance structure for DEI, which laid the groundwork for decision-making and strategic planning activities.

* **[2020-2022]** **New Office Build-Out**: I was part of the team that toured, selected, designed, and built out what would have been our new office when our existing lease expired.  I worked with experts and colleagues to plan and design new workspaces that integrated technology, accessibility, and inclusivity from the beginning to support a hybrid work environment.

* **[2020-2022]** **Centralized Identity Provider Rollout**: I coached the Manager of IT Operations on my team on how to develop business requirements and a comprehensive RFP for an Identity Provider as a Service (IdPaaS) through creating different customer and user personas, talking with stakeholders, and defining measurements for the underlying business capabilities that we wanted to improve. I also coached him in analyzing the responses and presentations to push sales representatives on questionable claims so that he could articulate the differences between the offerings and their impact on our business in order to make a recommendation. I then coached him and his team throughout the rollout process, which included working with different teams across the company to switch to SAML or Open ID, dramatically improving the employee experience and security posture through MFA, risk-based authentication controls, and fewer passwords.

* **[2019-2021]** **MIT Divesture:** MIT provided edX with incubation services for years, including payroll, benefits, and retirement. We also used some software licensing, networking, and support services from MIT. We had always planned on leaving MIT's incubation services and this project included making that happen:
  * **IT Services:** I coached and supported my IT Operations team in planning and implementing the services we needed to now run ourselves, including endpoint management software, Microsoft and Adobe software licencing, and endpoint security software.
  * **HRIS/HCM System:** I was the in-house project manager, technology lead, and data lead as we selected and implemented a new HCM/HRIS system to support payroll, benefits, retirement, performance, learning, and workforce planning.
  * **Change Management**: I developed a know, learn, do framework to communicate changes in benefits, processes, and systems across HR and IT to ensure that employees were well-prepared for changes and had ample time to learn about them before any impact.
* **[2019-2020]** **Salesforce and Netsuite Integration**: I led work to integrate Salesforce and Netsuite, which dramatically decreased the time to deliver products to customers and bill customers while dramatically increasing the quality of financial and order fulfillment data. This included working with Sales, Sales Operations, Legal, and Finance to re-engineer their processes to integrate the new technology and realize its benefits. 

* **[2018-2019]** **Automated Lead Sharing**: My team and I designed and deployed a lightweight, automated lead sharing solution for our Micromasters and Master's Degree programs to get leads to our partners in near real time. We built support for customers who could accept data via API as well as customers who needed to manually import data.

* **[2018-2018]** **Onboard B2B Sales onto Salesforce**: I worked with Sales Director and a consulting firm to build out our instance of Salesforce to support Velocity Sales when we launched edX for Business.

* **[2017-2017]** **CRM Technology Roadmap**: I retained the services of a CRM technology consultancy to do a comprehensive, organization-wide review of our existing CRM capabilities for our non-B2C customers (e.g., content partners, open source community, B2B partnerships). We delivered a roadmap that illustrated the opportunities for improving the way that we worked across functions to provide excellent service to our customers. 
* **[2016-2017]** **Information Security Policies**: I co-wrote Information Security policies with our General Counsel. We would update them as needed, at least annually.

* **[2016-2016]** **Vendor Management Process**: I worked with Legal to develop an on-boarding process for new Cloud and Software vendors with the goal of using a risk-based approach to consider legal, operational, and information security risks. We reviewed new vendors with business owners to understand the risks to edX and edX data and manage risk appropriately, which included modification of contractual terms, vendor product or process changes, or choosing a different vendor. I created a Service Desk to make it easy for employees to submit requests and for IT and Legal to review them.

* **[2015-2015]** **Chromebox for Meetings**: Soon after I joined edX, I built a case to migrate to invest in Google Chromebox for Meetings hardware for videoconferencing, replacing the Mac Minis previously used in each conference room. Customers were thrilled that most meetings became one-click to join, audio quality was improved dramatically, and it was easy to tell when meetings started and ended. I was able to clearly demonstrate a return on investment within 1 year through the reduction in time to start meetings, reduction in time to change presenters, and near-zero IT overhead for software updates and maintenance.
