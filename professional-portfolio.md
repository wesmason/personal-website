# Introduction 
Below you can find descriptions a few of the major projects that I was a part of during my career. I specify whether:
- I led the project directly;                                                          
- I coached and supported teams reporting to me to ensure that they were successful; or
- I provided major contributions to a project led by someone else

# Projects at edX
I started working at [edX](https://www.edx.org) in September 2015 through its acquisition by [2U](https://2u.com) in 2021. 
## Project Sunrise
From its inception until 2021, edX employees were MIT employees. From January 1st, 2021 and beyond, edX employees were employed directly by edX we were responsible for administering our own payroll, benefits, and retirement. As part of this change, we also transitioned away from our use of MIT IT services.

This was a major, multi-year project where I took on increasing responsibilities over time. Specifically, I stepped up to become the overall project manager for coordinating across IT, Legal, Finance, HR, and Facilities workstreams to ensure that edX would be fully ready to stop using MIT's services at the end of our services agreement. This included developing a focused, concise "know", "learn", "do" framework for the cross-functional "Project Sunrise" team to communicate changes to employees in advance of changes happening as well as during the period where employees would need to take action.

### Project Sunrise: IT Services Transition
As part of this project, my team and I developed and executed a plan to procure, configure, and deploy IT Services that MIT had previously provided and edX would now have to self-manage. I scoped most of the projects in this workstream with my Manager of IT Operations and then coached him and his team to develop success criteria and a plan to execute the projects against a strict timeline. We took an agile approach and developed minimum viable implementations for each IT capability we needed to bring in-house and then follow-up capabilities to further develop after all critical work was done on-time. 

- Integrating HCM with Cloud Identity and Access Management System for HR-Driven IAM 
- Bringing IT Support in-house
- Bringing licensing in-house for CRM, eSignature, Microsoft
- Bringing purchasing capabilities for endpoints in-house
- Deploying and migrating to new Endpoint Management infrastructure (Jamf Cloud, Intune)
- Deploying new endpoint protection software
- Deploying and migrating to new Endpoint Backups software
- Deploying and migrating to a new password management solution

### Project Sunrise: HRIS/HCM Implementation
As edX would now be responsible for administering payroll, benefits, and retirement for employees, we needed to spin up a Human Capital Management system to manage these HR capabilities. With the help of an HR Services firm, we selected and onboarded a new Human Resources Information Sustem (HRIS) / Human Capital Management (HCM) system.

Implementations would normally take at least 6 months to complete, but we successfully implemented the critical portions of the HCM system on an accelerated timeline (3 months). All eligible employees were enrolled in Benefits and were paid correctly for first payroll. 

My roles for the project included:
- **Project Manager:** As project manager, I coordinated resources across HR, Payroll, Benefits, and IT to ensure that key capabilities were implemented on time. I escalated issues both internally and with my counterparts at the vendor.     
- **Subject Matter Expert for Technology and Integrations:** As SME for integrations, I worked with internal teams to plan and develop integrations with critical edX Systems, including our Identity and Access Management system.    
- **Data Expert for all Employee Data:** As the data expert, I worked with internal teams, our counterparts at MIT, and with the vendor to ensure that critical HR data was of high quality and ready for import into the new system. While HR had the final say on all data quality matters, I was a thought partner for normalizing HR data and planning the technical configuration of the organizational structure in the HR system.      

## Salesforce <-> Netsuite Integration
I led a project to integrate Salesforce and Netsuite, which increased Sales Velocity, increased data quality, and improved data security, and improved the overall maturity of our Sales business capabilities. This project also laid the groundwork for a subsequent integration between Docusign and Salesforce to programmatically generate contracts. This included:

- Managing the overall project and stakeholders
- Directly managing in-house and contract technical staff
- Working with all teams (e.g., Sales, Sales Ops, Customer Success, Accounting) to clarify, document, and streamline their business processes
- Redesigning existing order forms to set a north star for a standardized, generalized order form
- Preparing business processes and technology systems to programmatically generate contracts and order forms with Salesforce, Conga, and Docusign

## Onboard B2B Sales Team to Salesforce
I partnered with our Director of Sales to plan and implement the technology changes to support or new B2B Sales Team. This included:
- changes to the Lead, Opportunity, and Account objects in Salesforce to support totally new use cases
- building out supporting reporting and dashboards
- on-boarding companion tools for Sales Executives
- being a thought partner on improving sales operations and handoffs to other teams
- and bringing in experts from around the organization to support requested changes
 
The project included a mix of managing contract resources and completing in-house work myself.
