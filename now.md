You can see my [About Me](/about-me) page for general information about me and below for what's going on now.[^1]

* 🧘🏼‍♂️ **Exercise**: Right now I'm on a pretty good schedule of doing yoga 4-5 times a week, including a Yin class which I've really enjoyed. My upstairs neighbor also put a rowing machine in the basement over the holidays, and I've started to use it for about 20 minutes each morning. Between these two, I've seen a marked decrease in back pain, which is pretty great!

* 📚 **Reading**: I'm currently reading [The Illiad](https://shop.penguin.co.uk/products/the-iliad-by-homer). I somehow graduated with a B.A. in Classics without having read it (🤷🏼‍♂️)️, which I think was largely due to my 8th grade teacher saying it wasn't really worth it. I've been alternating between enjoying finally getting to read an important part of Western Literature and being horrified with the casual violence of all kinds.

* 👨🏼‍🍳 **Cooking**: We've been trying out recipes from [Melissa Clark](https://www.melissaclark.net)'s _Dinner in One_, which we received back in September. Fun fact: It was supposed to arrive in March 2022, but the container it was on fell to the bottom of the ocean on its way from East Asia. 

* 🎮 **Video Gaming**: I'm currently playing [Elden Ring](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring), which is my first Dark Souls genre game. It's unforgiving in a way that has made the victories feel more exciting, but it's also... really gross? I've enjoyed how expansive the world is and how bewildering the storytelling is, but there's a level of violence and body horror that really isn't speaking to me.

* 🎲 **Board Gaming**: I haven't played any recently! Though -- I did get a copy of _[Love Letter: Princess Princess Ever After](https://renegadegamestudios.com/love-letter-princess-princess-ever-after/)_, which I've only played once and would love to play some more. It's very cute. I'm so happy that queer stuff like this is readily available now.
